# Fraud-Detection-in-Financial-Transactions


The project focused on building a predictive modeling pipeline to detect fraudulent financial transactions from a dataset of over 10,000 entries. By engineering behavioral and transactional features, the system was able to identify anomalies that traditional rule-based methods often overlooked. Machine learning models combined with statistical analysis achieved 85% precision and 75% recall, ensuring both accuracy and reliability. Benchmarking against logistic regression and rule-based approaches improved detection accuracy by 25%, demonstrating the modelâ€™s effectiveness. The end-to-end framework enabled real-time fraud monitoring while reducing false positives, providing a scalable solution for financial security.
